# hello-world
my first repository

Hi!

I'm Vincent, alias Vincent-inLisbon, a belgian in this wonderful country wich is Portugal.

My education is in management. Having worked recently on digital projects, I have been awakened to the importane of coding and its relative shortage. I now look at promoting and selling portguese digital know how and expertise in the Benelux and France.

I therefore wish to have a good understanding and knowledge of the digital world.

Thanks Odin for your help in my journey.

Vincent
